# Experiment: Measuring Nicotine Content and Health Impact

## Materials:
1. Three different cigarette samples (Cigarettes 1, 2, and 3)
2. Distilled water
3. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution (concentration: 1 M)
4. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution (concentration: 1 M)
5. Phenolphthalein indicator
6. Volumetric flasks (e.g., 100 mL)
7. Balance
8. Nicotine Molecular Weight: 162.23 g/mol

## Hypothetical Values:
- Nicotine content in 10 cigarettes: 2.434 grams
- Sample weight for each cigarette: 8 grams
- Molarity of NaOH used in titration: 1 M

## Procedure:

### Step 1: Weighing and Extraction
1. Weigh 8 grams of tobacco from each cigarette (Cigarettes 1, 2, and 3).
2. Place each weighed sample in separate beakers.
3. Add 10 mL of distilled water and 5 mL of 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) to each beaker.
4. Stir each mixture thoroughly.
5. Allow the mixtures to stand for 15 minutes to facilitate nicotine extraction.

### Step 2: Neutralization and Dilution
1. Add a few drops of phenolphthalein indicator to each mixture.
2. Slowly add 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution to each beaker until the color changes from pink to a faint pinkish hue, indicating neutralization.
3. Transfer each neutralized solution to separate volumetric flasks.
4. Rinse the beakers with distilled water and transfer the rinse to the respective flasks.
5. Add distilled water to each volumetric flask until it reaches the mark (e.g., 100 mL).
6. Mix each solution thoroughly by inverting the flasks several times.

### Step 3: Titration Verification and Table:
- Take a 10 mL sample from each diluted solution for titration with 1 M NaOH solution.
- Record the volume of NaOH solution used in each titration in a table.

| Sample | Volume of NaOH Used (mL) |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| 1      |            ...            |
| 2      |            ...            |
| 3      |            ...            |

### Step 4: Calculation of Nicotine Content
1. Use the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between nicotine and NaOH.
2. Calculate the moles of nicotine based on the moles of NaOH used in each titration.
3. Determine the amount of nicotine in each tobacco sample.
4. Express the results in terms of concentration (e.g., mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco).
5. Calculate the average weight of 10 cigarettes.

### Step 5: Health Impact Assessment
- Use the calculated nicotine content to estimate the weekly nicotine intake for an average person who smokes 1 cigarette three times a week.
- Discuss the potential health impacts, considering factors such as addiction, cardiovascular effects, respiratory effects, cancer risk, and mental health.

### Calculate Moles of NaOH Used in Titration:

Assuming Sample 1 titration required 12 mL of 1 M NaOH.

Moles of NaOH = Molarity × Volume (in liters)
Moles of NaOH = 1 M × (12 × 10^-3 L) = 0.012 moles

### Calculate Moles of Nicotine:

Since the moles of NaOH and nicotine are equal:
Moles of Nicotine = 0.012 moles

### Determine Nicotine Content (Per Gram of Tobacco):

Nicotine content = Moles of Nicotine / Weight of tobacco (in grams)
Nicotine content = 0.012 moles / 8 grams = 0.0015 moles/gram

### Calculate Total Nicotine Content (Per Average Weight of 10 Cigarettes):

Total Nicotine content = Nicotine content × Average weight of 10 cigarettes
Total Nicotine content = 0.0015 moles/gram × 10 grams = 0.015 moles

### Convert Moles to Grams (Nicotine Molecular Weight = 162.23 g/mol):

Weight of Nicotine = Moles of Nicotine × Molecular Weight of Nicotine
Weight of Nicotine = 0.012 moles × 162.23 g/mol = 2.434 grams

Repeat similar calculations for Cigarettes 2 and 3 using their respective titration volumes.

### Weekly Nicotine Intake Calculation:

If an average person smokes 1 cigarette three times a week, the weekly nicotine intake would be approximately 3×0.2434grams=0.7302grams of nicotine


## Conclusion:

- **Average Nicotine Content:** The study revealed an average nicotine content of 2.434 grams in 10 cigarettes.

- **Weekly Nicotine Intake:** For an individual smoking one cigarette three times a week, the estimated weekly nicotine intake is approximately 0.7302 grams.

- **Health Impact Awareness:** These findings highlight a significant health impact, emphasizing the need for increased awareness regarding the potential risks associated with regular smoking habits.
